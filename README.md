# Quantum Simulation: Wigner Function and Bifurcation Plots

## Overview
This project simulates the evolution of a quantum harmonic oscillator using the QuTiP library and performs a bifurcation analysis using a system of coupled differential equations. The simulation is based on two parts:

1. **Wigner Function Evolution**: Visualizes the evolution of a quantum system using Wigner functions.
2. **Bifurcation Plot**: Uses the RK4 method to simulate and plot bifurcation diagrams for a time-dependent system.

### Features:
- **Quantum Harmonic Oscillator**: Time evolution under a non-linear Hamiltonian.
- **Bifurcation Plot**: Tracks bifurcation behavior using a Lorenz-like system.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `qutip` (for quantum simulation)

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib qutip
```

## Part 1: Quantum Simulation with Wigner Function Evolution

### Parameters:
- `N = 20`: Dimension of the Hilbert space.
- `t_max = 1000`: Maximum simulation time.
- `t_step = 50000`: Number of time steps for simulation.
- `DELTA = 1`: Coefficient for the linear term in the Hamiltonian.
- `K = 1`: Coefficient for the non-linear term in the Hamiltonian.
- `P = 10 * DELTA`: Scaling factor for time-dependent perturbation.

### Key Components:

1. **Hamiltonians:**
   - `H0`: Main Hamiltonian for the quantum harmonic oscillator.
   - `H1`: Additional Hamiltonian for a two-photon driving term.
   - The total Hamiltonian is time-dependent.

2. **Initial State:**
   - The system is initialized in a coherent state: `psi0 = qt.coherent(N, 0)`.

3. **Time Evolution:**
   - The system evolves using `qt.mesolve`.

4. **Wigner Function:**
   - Wigner functions are computed at three different times (initial, mid, and final).

5. **Visualization:**
   - Plots of the Wigner function are displayed in a figure with three subplots for each time step.

### Output:
- A plot of the Wigner function at three time points (initial, mid-point, final).

## Part 2: Bifurcation Plot

### Parameters:
- `K = 1`: Non-linearity coefficient.
- `DELTA = 1`: Linear term coefficient.
- `P_init = 0`: Initial value of the time-dependent parameter.
- `P_final = 20*K`: Final value of the time-dependent parameter.
- `P_tfinal = 500/K`: Time scale for the parameter variation.

### Key Components:

1. **System Equations:**
   - The coupled differential equations governing the system are given by functions `f1` and `f2`.
   - The equations are solved using the Runge-Kutta method (RK4).

2. **Path Calculation:**
   - The function `getPath` numerically integrates the system equations to get trajectories `x1` and `x2`.

3. **Bifurcation Plot:**
   - The bifurcation plot is generated by plotting `x` and `y` against a normalized time-dependent parameter `p(t)`.

### Usage:

Run the following code to simulate and display the bifurcation plot:

```bash
python3 bifurcation_plot.py
```

### Output:
- A bifurcation plot showing the behavior of `x` and `y` as functions of the time-dependent parameter `p(t)`.

## Notes:
- **Wigner Function**: The Wigner function is a quasi-probability distribution used to visualize quantum states in phase space.
- **Bifurcation Plot**: This plot shows the system's behavior under changing conditions, highlighting transitions in stability.
